# Xeno Token Grabber
The original project comes from https://github.com/Chaxiraxi (https://github.com/Chaxiraxi/Discord-Token-Grabber/blob/main/grabber.js).
So credit to him/her.
This was originally in a different language, so I decided to make it my own and change the language to english.

# How to use
1. Go to `token-grabber.js` and press `Raw`.
2. Press `ctrl` + `a` and then press `ctrl` + `c`. (If on mac, do `command` + `a` then do `command` + `c`)
3. Press `ctrl` + `i` on your keyboard. (If on mac, do `command` + `shift` + `c`)
4. Go to the console tab and press `ctrl` + `v`. (If on mac, do `command` + `shift` + `v`)
5. Create the Discord Webhook and copy the url from it.
6. Where it says `webhook-url-here` in the code, replace that text with the webhook url you've copied.
7. Press enter and the victims Discord should reload and the webhook will be sent into the specific channel with all the account information.
